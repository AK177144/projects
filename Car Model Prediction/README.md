# Welcome to My Project

## Project info

This project predicts the **car model** from an uploaded image.  
The user can upload a photo of **any part of a car** (front, back, wheel, headlight, logo, etc.), and the system will:

1. 🏷️ Identify **which part of the car** is shown in the image  
2. 🚘 Predict the **car model**  
3. 📊 Show the **accuracy/confidence level** of the prediction  

### 🔍 How It Works 
- The model detects the car part from the library of 500+ car models and its parts+ 
- Based on the part, it predicts the most likely car model  
- Displays the confidence percentage for the prediction  

### 🎯 Features
- Upload any car part image  
- Real-time part detection  
- Car model prediction  
- Confidence score display  
- Simple and clean web interface  

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes images of different car parts such as:
- Headlights  
- Taillights  
- Wheels  
- Grilles  
- Logos  
- Side views and front views  

### 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more car models  
- Improve accuracy with a larger dataset  
- Add bounding-box object detection  
- Mobile app version
